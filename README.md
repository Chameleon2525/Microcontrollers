# Microcontrollers
C++ Programming Microcontrollers Module at the University of Huddersfield. I designed and implemented a fully operational MIDI-based controller system programmable to a PIC18F4520 microcontroller. The design features 5 digital inputs and 5 analogue inputs that allow the user to change various parameters of the MIDI messages transmitted.

This Project was part of my BSc Music Technology & Audio Systems degree, of which I obtained a 1st Class Honours.

Please refer to 'Microcontrollers Assignment Report.docx' for a more thorough overview of the project.
